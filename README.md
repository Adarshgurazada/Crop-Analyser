The dataset I have used for this transfer learning model is a combination of various datasets. The links to which are given below.
Rice Leaf Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minhhuy2810/rice-diseases-image-dataset
Wheat Leaf Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olyadgetch/wheat-leaf-dataset
Sugarcane Leaf Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prabhakaransoundar/sugarcane-disease-dataset

All these datasets are used for this model. 
The model is not hyperparemeter tuned. The images are just normalized and haven't been augmented.
